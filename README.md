# gitstat

Output detailed gitstats in csv format.

## Why?

Lots of git statistics programs out there, but for all of them I found myself doing a lot of post-processing. This post-processing consisted of two steps usually:

- Ignore extreme commits (e.g. a linter fixing lots of issues automatically)
- Ignore certain filetypes
- Make diagrams, overviews, etc

The only tool flexible enough to do both exploratory analysis and diagramming is your good olde stylesheet program.
